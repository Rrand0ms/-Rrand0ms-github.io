   <p> 'teratogen' comes from the words 'tera' and 'togen', tera meaning 'mother' and togen meaning 'monster'. Teratogen is a term used to describe birth defects like 'Microchephaly' which is caused by the mother having zika virus. Another example of a teratogen is the child having FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) caused by the mother drinking alcohol during her pregnancy  </p>
